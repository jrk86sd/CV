      <p>"I have extensive experience working in the field of health and wellness. A unique aspect of my Professional credentials has been the opportunity to work in the USA, Canada and Germany. My international experience allows me to incorporate
        different training methodologies into my training approach. I received my BSc of Kinesiology from California State University with an emphasis in Pre-Physical Therapy. I have 10 years of experience working with youth athletes and 5 years of
        experience of working in physical therapy clinics as a movement therapist. I have worked with all age groups from youth to elderly, different skill levels in sports, and many different injury types for rehabilitation. Furthermore, I was a
        coach
        for a national-level competitive jump-rope team for more than 5 years and many of the athletes I coached excelled in their respective events. I am passionate about helping people through exercise, movement, and therapy to reach and exceed
        their
        goals. Lastly, I understand that people are unique and need exercise and wellbeing to be tailored to their specific needs."</p>
